# Netflix Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing data related to Netflix, one of the leading streaming platforms globally. The dataset used contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including their titles, directors, cast, release year, duration, and genres.

## Motivation

The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into Netflix's content library. By exploring various aspects of the dataset, such as trends over time, popular genres, and regional preferences, we aim to understand Netflix's content strategy and audience preferences better.

## Dataset

- *Duration*: The duration (in minutes for movies, in seasons for TV shows).
- *Listed in*: The genres.
- *Description*: A brief description of the title.

## Analysis

The analysis encompasses several aspects of the Netflix dataset, including:

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Descriptive statistics, distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows), release trends over the years, etc.
2. *Popular Genres*: Identifying the most prevalent genres and their popularity over time.
3. *Regional Preferences*: Analyzing the distribution of content across different countries and regions.
4. *Content Ratings*: Understanding the distribution of content ratings and their relationship with other features.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

The analysis reveals several key findings, including:

- The increasing trend of Netflix's content library over the years.
- Dominant genres and their popularity.
- Regional variations in content preferences.
- Distribution of content ratings.

# Comprehensive Analytics Project

Welcome to our Analytics Dashboard Project, where we delve into the heart of data to uncover insights, trends, and predictions that drive strategic decision-making. Our project is structured into four core sections: Descriptive Analysis, Diagnostic Analysis, Predictive Analysis, and Prescriptive Analysis. Each section utilizes specific analysis types and visualization tools to bring our data to life. Let's dive in!

## 1. Descriptive Analysis

In this section, we explore the data as it is, laying the groundwork for deeper analysis.

### Average Ratings and Reviews

- *Analysis Type:* Univariate graphical, Statistics
- *Chart Type:* Bar charts for average ratings per company and Histograms for the distribution of ratings across companies.

### Salary and Benefits Overview

- *Analysis Type:* Bivariate
- *Chart Type:* Scatter plots visualize the relationship between average salary and total benefits, and Radar Charts compare different aspects of benefits across companies.

### Job Market Snapshot

- *Analysis Type:* Multivariate graphical, Statistics
- *Chart Type:* Bubble charts represent jobs available, interviews taken, and company size. Bar charts show total jobs available per company.

- ## 2. Diagnostic Analysis

Here, we aim to understand the 'why' behind our observations.

### Ratings and Company Factors Correlation

- *Analysis Type:* Correlation, Multivariate statistics
- *Chart Type:* Heat maps for visualizing correlations and Scatter plots for pairwise relationships.

### Text Analysis of Reviews

- *Analysis Type:* Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Collection
- *Chart Type:* Word clouds for common themes and Pie charts for review sentiments.

### Industry-Specific Trends

- *Analysis Type:* Clustering, Bivariate
- *Chart Type:* Radar Charts for industry-specific comparisons and Histograms for distributions by industry.

## 3. Predictive Analysis

Focusing on forecasting future trends based on our data.

### Ratings Forecasting

- *Analysis Type:* Predictive analysis, Time series analysis
- *Chart Type:* Line charts for trends and Scatter plots with regression lines for predictions.

### Salary and Job Market Trends


- *Analysis Type:* Multivariate statistics, Predictive analysis

- - *Chart Type:* Line charts for salary trends and Bubble charts for job market forecasts.

### Employee Satisfaction Prediction

- *Analysis Type:* Predictive analysis, Machine learning models
- *Chart Type:* Scatter plots for satisfaction predictions and Histograms for rating distributions.

## 4. Prescriptive Analysis

Leveraging AI for strategic decision-making.

### AI-Driven Decision Making

- *Analysis Type:* AI algorithms, Continuous Data Collection
- *Chart Type:* Dynamic dashboards for real-time updates and Bubble charts for market trend insights.
